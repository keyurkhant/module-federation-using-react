# Module Federation for Micro Frontend using React

Module Federation is a technique for building micro frontends, and it's typically used in the context of modern web development with technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Micro frontends aim to break down a monolithic frontend application into smaller, more manageable pieces, allowing different teams to work on separate parts of the application independently. Module Federation helps in achieving this by enabling code sharing and dynamic loading of remote modules in a micro frontend architecture.

1. Setup Your Micro Frontends:
Start by breaking down your monolithic frontend into smaller, self-contained micro frontend applications. Each micro frontend should be a separate React application with its own dependencies.

2. Webpack and Module Federation:
Webpack is a popular choice for implementing Module Federation. You need to configure Webpack in each micro frontend project to enable Module Federation.

3. Remote Entry Files:
When building your micro frontend applications, the Webpack configuration generates a remoteEntry.js file. This file contains information about the modules that the micro frontend exposes to other applications and the shared dependencies.

4. Host Application:
In the host application (the main shell that brings together the micro frontends), you need to load the remote modules using a dynamic import.
